[Scotland on Rails 2009](http://scotlandonrails.com/) was held at the
University of Edinburgh 26-28 March. I confess that when I registered
and made travel plans I regarded the conference as a good excuse to
visit Scotland but not much more. It ended up being one of the finest
conferences I have attended in a while. Good assortment of sessions,
fascinating speakers, a good venue and superlative organization made the
conference as valuable an experience as it was enjoyable. The conference
organizers deserve a lot of credit for the job they did.

For me, the highlight sessions included:

-   Marcel Molina's opening keynote -- fascinating and humorous insight
    into the early development of Rails.
-   Jim Weirich's session "Building Blocks of Modularity" -- turned out
    to actually be a thought provoking "Grand Unified Theory of
    Software Development".
-   Joe O'Brien's and Jim Weirich's "Ruby Code Review" -- shined a light
    on taking simple steps to rein in untested code (and earned a good
    many guffaws in the process).

But, yeah, it was still a good excuse to visit
