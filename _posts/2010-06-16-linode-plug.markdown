title: Why I use Linode
layout: post

I'm a very satisfied [Linode](http://www.linode.com/) customer. Their
control panel is powerful, they offer console access via SSH and
[Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), and they recently added
an on-site backup solution which works well. The hardware has proven
reliable as long as I've been with them. Their data center offerings
have terrific geographic diversity. And they've always offered a high
bang-to-buck ratio in terms of memory, storage and CPU.

So when they did
[this](http://blog.linode.com/2010/06/16/linode-turns-7-big-ram-increase/)
it seemed as good a time as any to add to the public praise for the
terrific service they provide.
