title: Swipe Navigation in Google Chrome in OS X Lion

After installing [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) on a Mac
running [OS X Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx) I was saddened to find
myself no longer able to navigate back and forth through the history by
swiping three fingers left and right on the trackpad. A little Googling
led me to [this helpful
nugget](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=36701a9aeca0d08c&hl=en).
Going to System Preferences → Trackpad → More Gestures and changing the
value for "Swipe between pages" to "Swipe with two or three fingers"
restored this helpful navigation gesture in Google Chrome. (If you use
[Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari), swiping with two fingers yields
the same results, but it's dressed up with pretty animations.)
