title: Capistrano, Ruby 1.9 and SSH Gateways â€” Resolved!
layout: post

A few months ago [I
posted](/capistrano/2011/01/16/capistrano-ruby19-ssh-gateway.html) about
inconsistent performance when running
[capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki) under [Ruby
1.9](http://www.ruby-lang.org) when SSH traffic was routed through a
gateway host. This problem appears to have been solved in a [recent
commit](https://github.com/net-ssh/net-ssh-gateway/commit/b448fe7da9ade93b798d812fb0c89d6fd2f7659c)
to net-ssh-gateway (kudos to Mat Trudel).

I discovered this when installing capistrano 2.6.0. Reading through the
updates I saw some promising references to a thread deadlocking issue
the existed under Ruby 1.9. After installing the new version of
capistrano (and net-ssh-gateway) I re-ran the tests described in my
[previous post](/capistrano/2011/01/16/capistrano-ruby19-ssh-gateway.html), and
sure enough, the improvement is outstanding!

Congratulations and my gratitude are due to the team of people presently
maintaining capistrano, net-ssh-gateway, etc.
